# Car-Price-Prediction-ML
## Description 
This project aims to predict the price of cars based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, curb weight, fuel type, and body type. The dataset consists of 205 car records with 26 attributes.

####  Data Preprocessing: 
Checked for missing values and handled outliers using Z-score.
Converted categorical variables into numerical format.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized relationships between car features and price using bar charts, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

#### Machine Learning Models Used:
Multiple Regression: Basic statistical approach.
##### Random Forest: Achieved R² = 0.94 (best model).
##### XGBoost: Performed well with R² = 0.91.
